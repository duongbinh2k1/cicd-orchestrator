3. Assess the severity level (critical, high, medium, low)
4. Provide immediate fixes that can be applied now
5. Suggest long-term preventive measures
6. Include relevant documentation links when possible

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You must respond with a valid JSON object containing:
{
  "summary": "Brief description of the issue",
  "root_cause": "Detailed root cause analysis",
  "category": "build_failure|test_failure|deployment_failure|configuration_error|dependency_issue|security_issue|infrastructure_issue|unknown",
  "severity_level": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "immediate_actions": ["action1", "action2"],
  "preventive_measures": ["measure1", "measure2"],
  "documentation_links": ["url1", "url2"],
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "estimated_fix_time": "time estimate in minutes"
}
